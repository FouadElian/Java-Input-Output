#Java-Input-Output
Welcome to Java-Input-Output! This Java project is designed to manage words entered into a vocabulary library. Its primary goal is to organize topics and the associated words within those topics efficiently.

#Purpose
The purpose of this project extends beyond managing words; it serves as a practical exploration of various Java concepts, including file input/output operations and data structures such as LinkedLists (double and single) and ArrayLists. Moreover, it offers insights into the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

#Benefits
File Manipulation: Gain hands-on experience in reading from and writing to text files in Java, enhancing your understanding of file handling mechanisms.
Data Structures: Explore the functionality and implementation of LinkedLists (both double and single) and ArrayLists, fostering a deeper comprehension of these fundamental data structures.
Object-Oriented Programming: Delve into the principles of OOP through practical application, solidifying your grasp of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

#Potential Errors
Should you encounter a FileNotFoundException upon cloning the repository and running the code, it may be due to issues related to the text files. In such cases, consider removing the files and re-adding them from your local machine, ensuring that they retain the same name and content.
